Hello rizzlies!

This is just the beta version of the website! This means that so far, it is only suitable for viewing on the web. Once you view this on a phone, it doesn't look so pleasant. 

These issues would be ADDRESSED later. As of RIGHT NOW, I'm trying my best to use CSS units that are relative to the width and height of the browser. 

Please DM me for ideas and changes to the website. Thanks. Or any question you got about the code.
